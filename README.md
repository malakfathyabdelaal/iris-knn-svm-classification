# iris-knn-svm-classification
A machine learning project using K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines to classify Iris flower species. Includes model comparison, accuracy evaluation, and visualizations.

# 🌸 Iris Classification using KNN & SVM

This machine learning project applies two classification models — **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** — to the popular **Iris dataset** to predict flower species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Build and compare the performance of two ML models
- Classify the species of iris flowers using four features:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Tested different values of `k`
- Evaluated model accuracy and classification report

### 2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Used linear kernel
- Visualized support vectors and decision boundaries

## 📊 Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| KNN   | 93%    |
| SVM   | 90%    |
